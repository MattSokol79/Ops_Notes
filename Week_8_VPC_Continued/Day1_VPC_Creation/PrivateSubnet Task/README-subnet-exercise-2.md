## Timings

40 - 120 Minutes

## Summary

Now that we've created a public subnet & private subnet it's time to get everything working!

Install the DB in private subnet, configure it as you have before and make sure you allow communication to flow correctly on the right ports and to the right ips!

As in the previous, this netowking and flow of information can be hard to visualise! So:

Make sure you have clear mental picture of what your trying to achieve. You know what helps having a clear mental picture? A real picture &/or drawing!

## Tasks

* Install mongodb
* configure mongodb
* Get post to work

Hint: Draw out whats communicating with what.

## Tips

You might have to make your private network not private for some time.

## Acceptance Criteria

* VPC has a private subtnet
* VPC has a public subtnet
