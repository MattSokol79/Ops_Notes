## gem and bundler VS pip and packages
- gems are packages in ruby or dependencies
- bundler is ruby's package manager

- Gemfile keeps a list of depndencies to be installed

- To install gems from the Gemfile, you run: `gem install bundler`
-> Lets install bundler

## Ruby's testing framework is rspec
- rspec needs to be installed

## JS package manager is npm (node package manager)
- npm packages

- After version 6.0 (not sure the actual version), comes pre loaded with NPM.

## Ubuntu package manager
- apt-get (or just apt)

1. In bash, go to folder with Gemfile -> spec/
2. Run `bundle` 
3. 
**Running Tests**
- Run `rake spec`
